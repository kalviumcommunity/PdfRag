# **DataSpeaks**

*Turn natural language into instant information.*

## **Overview**

DataSpeaks lets you query your data by simply asking questions in plain English. No more writing queries or digging through dashboards—just ask:

> *“Show pending invoices for August”*
> and get structured results directly from your database.

Powered by AI, DataSpeaks combines **Prompt Engineering**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **Function Calling**, and **Structured Output** to make your data truly speak to you.
